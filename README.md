### PROJECT: ENHANCED GRADING SYSTEM APP

THIS PROJECT WILL BASE UPON GRADING SYSTEM CODES THAT WOULD DETERMINE YOUR GRADE, GPA, AND AVERAGE ALL THROUGHOUT THE SEMESTER. THE CODE WILL BE BUILT WITHIN JAVA'S ACM GRAPHICS SO IT CAN BE UTILIZED AS AN APP RATHER THAN INPUTTING IN CONSOLE.  WITH ADJUSTABLE PASSING GRADE, IT IS WIDELY SUITED FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE A SET AMOUNT OF SUBJECTS WITHIN THE TERM AS YOU CAN PUT HOW MANY AS YOU WANT.
